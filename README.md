Physics project and Math
Tug of War
Concept
This project has in its gut the goal to make everything based on real world physics
The idea/concept of the project was to create a game like the classic Tug of War and make it as fun as possible
Why the game is like that?
Although in my game there is not actual rope with a flag attached and there is not people pulling the rope.
